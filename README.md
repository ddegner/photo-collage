## ❓ FAQ

### Can I use this with any WordPress theme?

Yes! Photo Collage is designed to work with any WordPress theme that supports the block editor (Gutenberg). The collages are built using standard WordPress blocks and will inherit your theme's styling.

### Is it responsive on mobile devices?

Absolutely. You can enable the **"Stack on Mobile"** option to automatically arrange images vertically on screens smaller than 782px. This ensures your collages look great on all devices.

### How many images can I add to a collage?

You can add as many images as you need. The Quick Layout presets range from 2 to 6 images, but you can manually add more images to any collage.

### Can I adjust the position of individual images?

Yes! Each image has extensive positioning controls including margins, padding, absolute positioning (top/right/bottom/left), rotation, opacity, and z-index layering.

### Can I convert existing collages if I uninstall the plugin?

Yes! The plugin includes an uninstall settings page where you can choose to convert your Photo Collage blocks to either static HTML (preserving the visual layout) or core WordPress image blocks (preserving editability) before uninstalling.

### Are there any performance concerns?

Photo Collage is optimized for performance. It uses modern CSS for positioning and transforms, avoiding heavy JavaScript. Images are loaded using WordPress's native media handling, which includes lazy loading support.
